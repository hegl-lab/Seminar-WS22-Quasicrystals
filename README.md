# HEGL Quasiperiodic Patterns

## About

This project was done as part for a seminar of the [Heidelberg HEGL group](https://hegl.mathi.uni-heidelberg.de/).

It is heavily inspired by a bachelor thesis about [Computing Quasiperiodic Patterns
in Python](http://pcwww.liv.ac.uk/~hemraj/thesis/BSc/2021_Daniel_Gouldsbrough_BSc_Thesis.pdf)

Key tasks included understanding the surrounding topic and rewriting & extending the given python
code into javascript using [p5js](https://p5js.org/)

The seminar group aimed to create an interactive website to help anyone understand and visualize the concepts stated in aboves paper.
